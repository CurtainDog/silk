# License

Silk will definitively be released as **open source** but I haven't really decided with license to take.
Most likely it will be the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.
I will select one before the first official release. If you have any suggestions please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
