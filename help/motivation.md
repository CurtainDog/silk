## Why DI / IoC ?
There are enough articles out there explaining the benefits of dependency injection as a tool to 
achieve inversion of control and why this is important. Let me just remind you that everything has 
drawbacks too. Before using a DI framework like Silk you should be sure, that the benefits 
outbalance the drawbacks. 

## Why another DI / IoC framework ?
Dependency injection has been around for quite awhile now. For Java there are a few big or mature 
players and a vast number of smaller or younger ones. **Still none of them is satisfactory.**

I will explain this is detail as soon as I find time.
