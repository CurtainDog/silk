### Java Dependency Injection

#### About
You find more information about Silk on its project page: http://jbee.github.com/silk/

#### Status
The project is in a late conception phase. Most of the core concepts are implemented and will just get minor adjustments. But a few are missing. As long as those are under development there will be no examples but you can always look at the tests (the ones in the `bind` package demonstarte the features quite nice).

Please come back soon and check for updates.
