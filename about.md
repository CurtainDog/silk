# About

## What is Silk ?
Once I tried described to a non programmer what I do in my spare time. 

I said: 

**Silk is.. the lines between the dots.**

And that's pretty much it. I chosen the name Silk because this lines are elegant, thin but robust. 

If I should describe Silk to a (Java) programmer I'd say that Silk is guice just without the bad parts plus a powerful concept of modularity and services. For those how are programmer but do not know guice there is the bald fact: Silk is a Java dependency injection framework without pixie dust and a service concept that enables pure awesomeness.    

## Who did it ?  
It is a one man show. I coded all the Java and did the website and everything else connected to the project.
