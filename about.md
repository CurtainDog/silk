# About

## What is Silk ?
When I tried described to a non programmer what I do in my spare time I came up with something like:

**it's the lines between the dots...**

and that's pretty much it. The name Silk is chosen because this lines are elegant, lightweight, thin and transparent but still reliable and robust. So silk as a material matches what we are looking for when connecting software components like we do with DI.

How much more is there to be said for all (Java) programmers ? Silk is guice just without the pain parts plus a powerful concept of modularity and services. For those how are programmer but do not know guice there is the bald fact: Silk is a Java dependency injection framework without pixie dust and a service concept that enables pure awesomeness.    

## Who did it ?  
It is a one man show. I coded all the Java and did the website, logo and everything else connected to the project during my spare time in the last couple of month.
